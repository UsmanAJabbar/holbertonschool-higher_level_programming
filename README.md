# Holberton School - Higher Level Programming
This repository contains all the logic files necessary to complete the tasks offered by the Holberton School Curriculum.

Unlike previous repositories, this resposity focuses on Higher-End Languages such as Python, SQL, Java and more.

This repository showcases my my gradual growth from knowing nothing about these languages to actually working with these languages and environments.

This repository may contain the occasional easter eggs, memes and comments to keep coding engaging. Comments are definitely the occasional sight in here as my personal goals are to write code thats readable and snappable as we come back to such concepts in the near future.
